Introduction
================================

This is python version of seismic data processing tools. It contains modules for signal processsing, window selection and adjoint source constructor.

Functionality
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Singal Processing

   It is signal processing workflow defined for adjoint tomography, but should work for most seismology cases. It uses obspy functions.

2. Window selection

   Select windows on a observed and synthetic seismograms. This modules uses pyflex.

3. Adjoint source constructor

   Construct windows based on observed data, synthetic data and windows selected. It uses pyadjoint'.
